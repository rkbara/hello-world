# hello-world
This is my first thing ever 

So my name is Robyn.  I am a 34 year old woman who is just starting to learn about tech.  Several of my friends have told me they thought this might be a good career choice for me, so I have decided to explore the industry a bit and see if I fit.  I have done a lot of different jobs in my life; cook, paramedic, chemist, Uber driver, and hostess have all been things I have done at some point in time.  Every job has involved the use of networked computers and at the very least, learning about how this all works will be a useful set of knowledge to have.  kthxbye
